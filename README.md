# spark-examples

This repository contains a running series of Spark examples for comparison with a matching series of Dataflow examples.

Before diving in here, you likely want to read [Dataflow/Beam & Spark:
A Programming Model Comparison](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/blog/dataflow-beam-and-spark-comparison).

The equivalent Dataflow code lives in [GoogleCloudPlatform/DataflowJavaSDK-examples](http://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/DataflowJavaSDK-examples/tree/master/src/main/java8/com/google/cloud/dataflow/examples/complete/game) and is documented in [Mobile Gaming Pipeline Examples](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/examples/gaming-example).

For details on running these examples on a Google Cloud Dataproc cluster, please see this [README](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/spark-examples/blob/master/gaming/java/README.md).
